- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fengshi-Teng
- 👀 Interested in CS+art/history/travel/books, trying to create something fun
- 🌱 Currently studying in MPCS, UChicago
- 🏠 Used to be an Architecture student and still love it

I’m a creative problem solver with a unique journey transitioning from architecture to computer science. With 5 years of design and spatial thinking experience, combined with my growing technical expertise in programming and software development, I bring a blend of creativity, logic, and innovation into every project.

My passion for technology drives me to explore cutting-edge tools and emerging trends, and I believe coding itself is a form of art — a way to turn imagination into reality.

Outside of work, I have a deep love for visual arts, music, and films, having spent over 10 years studying fine art and learning creative storytelling. I’m also a sports enthusiast, from fitness, running, hiking to leading my university’s Water Sports Club and competing on the Dragon Boat Team.

I take pride in being a highly self-motivated and efficient learner, always planning ahead and pushing myself to deliver high-quality work ahead of deadlines.

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, actively seeking opportunities to apply my creative and technical skills in real-world challenges. I’m especially interested in roles related to software development, creative technology, and data-driven innovation.
